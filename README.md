# SwiftDawn (WIP)

This is the documentation for the project started by Nat3z and now maintained by Salesian College Preparatory as a drop-in replacement for [Dawn](https://github.com/pioneers/dawn) by Pioneers in Engineering.

## Why SwiftDawn?

SwiftDawn is a *fast*, *easy*, and **robust** version of the original Dawn software and is essentially a remake/reimagining of what Dawn is. The current Dawn software is missing the following features:
* Syntax Highlighting
* Reliable SSH Connections
* Terminal Errors

SwiftDawn aims to add these features along with much more to make SwiftDawn **the easiest** way to create robots.

## TODO List
- [ ] Linking Gamepad Daemon with the VSCode Extension
- [ ] VSCode Error Handler
- [ ] Script Runner/Debugger
- [x] SSH Connections
- [x] File Uploading
- [x] Gamepad Daemon

Keep in mind that this software is currently in **DEVELOPMENT** stages and is still being actively developed by contributors. We **DO NOT** recommend using SwiftDawn as a replacement for the original Dawn Software (yet).
